We use testing to help us find faults and (potential) failures during software
development, maintenance and operations. We do this to help reduce the risk
of failures occurring in an operational environment - in other words once the
system is being used - and to contribute to the quality of the software system.

Main testing objectives on Hiilti IoT Gateway project are:
• finding defects;
• gaining confidence in and providing information about the levelof quality;
• preventing defects.


All needed equipment exists including faraday's cage, real gateways and Hilti BLE tags

Testing process started on the very early project phase and is done in parallel with development

QA team is a part of development team and is placed in the same location as a result it has needed level of independence but is not isolated from the dev team so here are the benefits:


    The tester sees each defect in a neutral perspective
    The tester is totally unbiased
    The tester sees what has been built rather than what the developer thought
    The tester makes no assumptions regarding quality
    The tester is able to communicate with development team with no delays



Testing is done on different environments - local(with local MQTT broker), on Hilti Q environment(https://ontrack-q.hilti.com/ontrack/#/) using real life configuration and Hilti Q ontrack application.

Testing is done according to test cases that were elicted from requirements and specification

Testing is done according to test suites that consist of functional and non functional test cases.

Services provided by Rigado are covered with functional and non functional test cases which are a part of regression test suite.

Each new release candidate is tested using regression test suite before release.

All testing related documentation is created and maintained in Hilti Jira and Hilti Confluence

Issues found during testing are logged to Jira and retested after the fix. Also they are added to regression test suite and retested before next release with release candidate
